**1. The first task can be described as such:**  
 <p> I need to find an intersection of some countable number of lists.
 <p> Example:
<code>  <p> Input: list1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
<p> list2 = [2, 3, 4]
<p> list2 = [1, 3, 4, 6, 7]
<p> Output: [3, 4]
        
  </code>
 <p> Probably, I need to use recursion to solve this issue.
